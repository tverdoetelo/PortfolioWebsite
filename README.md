## The fifth project of the analytical bootcamp for Data Analysts:
### Site creation and customization

**The main idea:**
>To create a simple portfolio website with the most important information about me and my skills.

**Tasks:**
>Selection of suitable template to minimize resource requirements (energy and time).
>
>Customisation (adding suitable sections, titles, subtitles, descriptions, pictures, links).
>
>Selecting and setting hosting.

**Selection of template:**
>This was my first experience with HTML & CSS, so to simplify the task I used [HTML5UP - resource with ready-made templates](https://html5up.net/)
>It has many different stylish templates.
>
>I totally recommend it!

**Customisation:**
>The longest and most interesting part.
>>First, I added the subsections I needed, removed the unnecessary blocks, and then posted all the information.
>>
>>The most energy-intensive thing is to pick and create pictures, but I think I did a great job.
>>
>>In the end, I supported all the information with buttons and links under headers, buttons and pictures.

**Selecting and setting hosting for website:**
>[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is very useful service that hosted directly from GitHub repository.
>My GitHub Pages site was built from the main branch and was deployed to the github-pages environment by the pages build and deployment workflow.
>Link: https://tverdoetelo.github.io/PortfolioWebsite.github.io/

**Conclusion:**
>[This portfolio site](https://tverdoetelo.github.io/PortfolioWebsite.github.io/) was built using Visual Sttudio Code, Life Server, [HTML5UP resource with ready-made templates](https://html5up.net/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
>This website is useful to share information about me and my skills.
